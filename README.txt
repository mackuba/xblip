xBlip
-----

xBlip is a native iPhone client for blip.pl, Polish microblogging service.

Note: xBlip is currently in "Shitty First Draft" stage (or, more technically, very early alpha). Which means, if anything
doesn't work, looks like shit, doesn't have essential features, explodes when you touch it, or if the code has high
WTF/minute rate - that's intended :)

The ObjectiveBlip directory contains the backend code that handles the connection to Blip API. It's considered a separate
subproject, and released under Beerware license (see comments in headers). You can use it to create your own Blip clients
in ObjectiveC/Cocoa if you want.
