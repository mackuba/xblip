xBlip is a native iPhone client for blip.pl, Polish microblogging service.

Note: xBlip is currently in "Shitty First Draft" stage (or, more technically, very early alpha). Which means, if anything
doesn't work, looks like shit, doesn't have essential features, explodes when you touch it, or if the code has high
WTF/minute rate - that's intended :)
